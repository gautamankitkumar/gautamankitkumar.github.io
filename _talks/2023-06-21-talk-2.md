We investigated and compared the catalytic activity of alpha-MoC and beta-Mo2C as an inexpensive substitute of Pt for formic acid electro-oxidation. We developed surface Pourbaix diagrams for MoXCY surfaces and reveal a substantial degree of surface oxidation which enables oxidation in an electrochemical environment.
