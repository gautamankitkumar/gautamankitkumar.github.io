<div style="text-align: justify"> My research sits at the intersection of modeling and experiments, where I use computational tools to interpret results and guide experimental directions. I have experience in applying a broad range of modeling techniques, from first-principles calculations to process simulations, to derive insights that inform materials and process design. During my PhD, I focused on using first-principles computational modeling to design and understand materials relevant to sustainable technologies. The following infographic tries to capture the most important features. </div>

<b> Career vision </b>

My goal is to join an industrial R&D team to drive innovation at the intersection of chemistry and computational modeling. I am particularly passionate about applying methods such as first-principles modeling and machine learning to enhance multiscale modeling, integrate simulations with experimental data, and enable faster, data-driven materials.


As a small exhibit of my work, check out this atomic-level interaction we found guiding the enantioselectivity.
