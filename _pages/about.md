# Website under construction

# Hello There
I am Ankit, a graduate student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I work in the field of computational catalysis towards design of sustainable catalyst materials using Multiscale-modelling techniquest such as Density-Functional Theory calculations, Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo methods.

I completed my master's from Carnegie Mellon University and thus live in Pittsburgh, PA as of now. I am looking forward to move to Urbana-Champaign in Fall 2021.
