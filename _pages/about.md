Hello, I'm Ankit. I am a computational process engineer specializing in translating complex theoretical models into practical, experimental guidance. I have over 7 years of computational modeling research experience in heterogeneous catalysis and more than 5 peer-reviewed publications. Additionally, I have 1+ year in the pharmaceutical industry and +1 year with wet-lab research experience.

I excel in interdisciplinary environments, collaborating across Chemistry, MatSE, and MechE, and am committed to knowledge sharing, having mentored 5+ students. I will be graduating in late 2025 or early 2026 and actively seeking industrial opportunities that apply my computational skills and background in a collaborative setting.

Core competencies:
 - Density functional theory calculations
 - Reaction Mechanism elucidation
 - Thermodynamics and Kinetics
 - Machine Learning


Check out this atomic-level interaction we found guiding the enantioselectivity.
