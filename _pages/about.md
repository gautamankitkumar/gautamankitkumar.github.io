# Hello There
I am Ankit, a graduate student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My project involves working with techniques such as multiscale modeling methods such as Density-Functional Theory calculations, Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.

I completed my master's from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA and completed my bachelors from IIT Bombay, India.

I am looking to collaborate in the field of computational catalysis towards design of sustainable catalyst materials towards renewable energy sources.
