Hello! I'm Ankit, a final-year graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, passionate about leveraging computational tools to design advanced materials and molecules.

My expertise lies in first-principles methods like Density-Functional Theory and *ab initio* thermodynamics. My goal is to make quantum-mechanical calculations more accessible and efficient for accelerating in-silico materials design.
