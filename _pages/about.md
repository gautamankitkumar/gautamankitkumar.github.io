<div style="text-align: justify"> My research sits at the intersection of modeling and experiments, where I use computational tools to interpret results and guide experimental directions. I have experience in applying a broad range of modeling techniques, from first-principles calculations to process simulations, to derive insights that inform materials and process design. During my PhD, I focused on using first-principles computational modeling to design and understand materials relevant to sustainable technologies. The following infographic tries to capture the most important features. </div>

I am looking for industrial roles that leverage my expertise on connecting modeling to experiments, ideally starting late 2025 or early 2026.


As a small exhibit of my work, check out this atomic-level interaction we found guiding the enantioselectivity.
