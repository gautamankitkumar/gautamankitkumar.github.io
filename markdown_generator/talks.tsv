Phase-dependent catalytic activity of in situ-oxidized molybdenum carbide for formic acid electro-oxidation	Talk	talk-1	ACS Fall 2022	2022-08-22	Chicago, IL	https://acs.digitellinc.com/p/s/phase-dependent-catalytic-activity-of-in-situ-oxidized-molybdenum-carbide-for-formic-acid-electro-oxidation-514344	Fuel cells enable clean and efficient energy generation in portable power sources to be used in automotive, military, and space applications. The platinum group metals (PGM) are some of the most active fuel cell electrocatalysts, but their high price and scarcity hinder large-scale fuel cell commercialization. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have long been regarded as cost-effective PGM substitutes offering improved physical properties and high catalytic activity towards some reactions. Recently, nanosized TMCs have been synthesized that exhibit a complex size- and phase-dependent stability and catalytic properties. In this work, we employ a combination of density functional theory, ab initio thermodynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, and electronic structure analysis of MoxCy catalysts to reveal phase-, potential-, and pH-dependent surface structure and composition, nature of the active site, and its catalytic activity for formic acid electro-oxidation. We develop Pourbaix diagrams for representative MoxCy surfaces and reveal a substantial degree of surface oxidation (either monolayer-limited or penetrating to the bulk) in an electrochemical environment. Mechanistic studies unfold a phase-dependent inhibiting or promoting effect of an oxygen overlayer that modifies the free energies of co-adsorbed reaction intermediates. Finally, machine learning tools shed light on the structure of TMC nanoparticles and help bridge the materials gap.

Phase-dependent promoting effect of surface oxygen on molybdenum carbide catalysts during formic acid electrooxidation	Talk 	talk-3	2023 Joint Midwest & Great Lakes Regional Meeting	2023-10-19	St. Louis, MO	Number318	Transition metal carbides (TMC) have long been heralded as inexpensive substitutes for Pt-group metals (PGMs) because of their similarities in chemical activity and electronic structure. TMCs offer vast catalyst design space owing to their particle-size-dependent polymorphism, tunable non-stoichiometric composition, and phase-dependent catalytic activity. Compared to Pt-group-based catalysts, TMCs exhibit higher stability and resistance to corrosion in their electrochemical operation, thus making them attractive low-cost electrocatalysts for sustainable energy generation and conversion. Unlike PGMs, TMCs are very oxophilic, which may limit their catalytic efficiency in oxidation and electrooxidation reactions due to the blocking of the catalytic sites by O* species. Contrary to this expectation, recent experimental findings reveal the significant co-catalytic activity of TMCs in the electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, and formic acid. The underlying mechanism for this unusual catalytic activity remains elusive. In this work, we employ a combination of density functional theory (DFT), ab initio thermodynamics, and reaction rate theory to unravel the source of TMC catalytic activity in oxidation reactions. We investigate a model reaction system, namely formic acid electrooxidation on the meta-stable alpha-MoC1-x phase, which was selected based on its reported excellent catalytic activity in low-temperature water-gas shift and methanol oxidation. The kinetics-cognizant surface Pourbaix diagram that we developed reveals in situ surface modification at varying electrochemical conditions. The origin of alpha-MoC1-x high catalytic activity is attributed to unique oxycarbide motifs which weaken otherwise strong surface-adsorbate interactions as supported by the calibrated Bader charge analysis and energy decomposition analysis. We hypothesize that this counterintuitive promotional effect of in situ-deposited surface oxygen may be present in a range of electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reactions on other TMCs.

Phase-Dependent Promoting Effect of Surface Oxygen on Molybdenum Carbide Catalysts during Formic Acid Electrooxidation	Talk 	talk-6	2024 AIChE Annual Meeting	2024-10-30	San Diego, CA	https://proceedings.aiche.org/conferences/aiche-annual-meeting/2024/proceeding/paper/569cu-phase-dependent-promoting-effect-surface-oxygen-on-molybdenum-carbide-catalysts-during-formic	Transition metal carbides (TMC) are abundant and promising low-cost electrocatalyst as they exhibit Pt-like catalytic activity. When combined with metal catalysts, TMCs demonstrate excellent performance towards C-H and O-H bond breaking in an oxidizing environment. The high TMC activity, however, contrasts with their highly oxophillic nature, which should cause rapid deactivation by strongly adsorbed O* atoms. Understanding the effect of surface oxidation on catalytic behavior and material stability is key to resolving this TMC catalysis puzzle and enabling TMC usage in electrochemical operations. Here, we elucidate the surface structure and catalytic activity of β-Mo2C and alpha-MoC phases under electrochemical conditions using density functional theory and kinetics-informed ab initio thermodynamics calculations. The β-Mo2C(011)-C surface was investigated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alpha-MoC(311)-Mo for formic acid electrooxidation (FAEO). Kinetics-informed Pourbaix diagrams reveal that both surfaces are extensively oxidized with the alpha-MoC phase showing greater stability with respect to surface C removal through CO/CO2 release (onset potential 0.72 V) over β-Mo2C (onset potential 0.46 V. Surface oxidation on β-Mo2C is found to be detrimental towards HER[1] since all metal sites are predicted to be covered with O*/OH* species. In contrast, partial surface oxidation on alpha-MoC has a promoting effect towards FAEO, as the surface exposes undercoordinated Mo sites with a weakened binding affinity toward reactive intermediates due to repulsive lateral O* interactions. The alpha-MoC-catalyzed FAEO is predicted to proceed through OH*-mediated C-H scission as a rate-limiting step, similar to FAEO on Pt(111). Surface stability and electrocatalytic activity trends are confirmed experimentally using CV and XPS measurements. The computational evidence for the phase-dependent promoting effect of surface O* on TMC catalytic activity opens up new opportunities for the wider use of TMCs in electrocatalysis.
